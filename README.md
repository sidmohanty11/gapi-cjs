# gapi-cjs
A [gapi-script](https://github.com/partnerhero/gapi-script) alternative which uses commonjs module. Has some changes in the gapiScript so that it eliminates errors like:
- `this` is set to undefined
- jest error - import can't be used outside module
- using of eval directly

## Usage
```
npm i gapi-cjs
```
